#The program asks the user for input N (positive integer) and reads it.
#Then the program asks the user for input k (positive integer) and reads it.
#Then the program asks the user to provide N (x, y) points (one by one) and reads all of them: 
#first: x value, then: y value for every point one by one. X and Y are the real numbers.
#In the end, the program asks the user for input X and outputs: the result (Y) of k-NN Regression if k <= N, or any error message otherwise.
#Additionally, provide the variance of labels in the training dataset.
#The basic functionality of data processing (data initialization, data insertion), 
#should be done using Numpy library while the computation (ML) part should be done using Scikit-learn library as much as possible 
#(note: you can combine with what you've done from the previous task).
